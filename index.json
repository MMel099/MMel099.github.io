The “K” in K-Means represents the predetermined number of clusters the algorithm aims to identify. It’s an unsupervised learning method, meaning it does not require labeled training data to function.\nHow It Works: Initialization: K-Means begins by selecting K initial centroids, one for each cluster. These centroids can be randomly chosen data points or strategically placed based on some prior knowledge.\nAssigning Data Points to Clusters: Each data point is assigned to the cluster whose centroid is closest to it. Proximity is typically measured using Euclidean distance, but other distance metrics can be employed based on the nature of the data.\nUpdating Centroids: After the initial assignments, the centroids are recalculated by taking the mean of all the data points within each cluster. This step iterates until the centroids no longer change significantly or a predetermined number of iterations is reached.\nConvergence: The algorithm converges when the centroids stabilize, and the assignments remain unchanged between iterations.\n# This is a K-Means algorithm implemented from scratch # It initializes k random centroids and assigns points to clusters using euclidean distance # With each iteration, centroids are recaluclated based on the mean of data points assigned to that cluster # If a smaller euclidean distance to another centroid is identified, the data point is reassigned to the other cluster # The algorithm will converge when centroids become statatic or after 100 iterations, whichever happens first # Arguments: k is predetermined number of clusters; X is input data # Returns: centroids are values of cluster centersl labels are cluster assignments for each data point import numpy as np import pandas as pd def KMeansFromScratch(k, X): centroids = X[np.random.choice(range(X.shape[0]), k, replace=False)] for i in range(100): prev_centroids = centroids distances = np.concatenate([np.linalg.norm(X - centroid, axis=1).reshape(-1, 1) for centroid in centroids],axis=1) labels = np.argmin(distances, axis=1) centroids = pd.DataFrame(np.concatenate([X, labels.reshape(-1, 1)], axis=1)).groupby(2).mean().values if np.array_equal(centroids, prev_centroids): return centroids, labels return centroids, labels Wikipedia Author: Chire\nApplications of K-Means: Image Compression: K-Means can be used to reduce the number of colors in an image, effectively compressing it while preserving its essential features.\nCustomer Segmentation: Businesses utilize K-Means to categorize customers based on purchasing behavior, allowing for targeted marketing strategies.\nAnomaly Detection: K-Means can identify outliers or anomalies in datasets by grouping normal data points into clusters and isolating those that deviate.\nGenetic Clustering: In biological research, K-Means helps classify genes with similar expression patterns, aiding in the identification of gene functions.\nChallenges and Considerations: Sensitivity to Centroid Initialization: K-Means results can vary based on the initial placement of centroids, and multiple runs with different initializations may be needed to find the optimal solution.\nAssumption of Spherical Clusters: The algorithm assumes that clusters are spherical and equally sized, which may not be suitable for all types of data.\nPossibility of Empty Clusters: As the algorithm iterates to convergence, there is a chance that all data points get reassigned from a cluster, leaving it empty. A common solution is to choose a random point to act as a new centroid if any empty clusters are detected.\n# This is a comprehensive K-Means Algorithm using the sklearn package # Outliers are identified using isolation forest and removed # Model fit is evaluated using normalized mutual information by comparing predicted labels to ground truth labels # Ten runs of K-Means are completed and the model with the highest NMI score is selected # Arguments: k is predetermined number of clusters; X is input data; true_labels are ground truth labels # Returns: final_centroids are values of cluster centers; final_labels are cluster assignments for each data point from sklearn.cluster import KMeans from sklearn.ensemble import IsolationForest from sklearn.metrics import normalized_mutual_info_score import numpy as np def ComprehensiveKMeans(k, X, true_labels) isolation_forest = IsolationForest() isolation_forest.fit(X) outliers = isolation_forest.predict(X) X = X[outliers == 1] kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=k) best_score = -1 best_model = None for i in range(10): kmeans.fit(X) labels = kmeans.predict(X) score = normalized_mutual_info_score(labels, true_labels) if score \u0026gt; best_score: best_score = score best_model = kmeans final_labels = best_model.predict(X) final_centroids = …","date":1704153600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1704153600,"objectID":"49862c2d07e897408721feb14dec3c05","permalink":"https://example.com/post/kmeans/","publishdate":"2024-01-02T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/kmeans/","section":"post","summary":"Introduction to K-Means Clustering","tags":null,"title":"K-Means Algorithm","type":"post"},{"authors":["Max Melnikas"],"categories":null,"content":"Abstract In the realm of psychology and neuroscience, understanding human experiences and emotions through word usage can present a fascinating and diﬀicult challenge. Words choice can be highly person and context-dependent. However, with a large enough sample of written answers to a single question prompt, we may be able to identify certain trends in word usage.\nIn this project, I used a dataset (X. Alice Li and Devi Parikh, 2019) that contains a large number (N = 1473) of written responses to the question: “What were salient aspects of your day yesterday? How did you feel about them?”. Additionally, each response is labelled with one or more emotion from an exhaustive list of 18 different emotions.\nIn my analysis, I attempted to find associations between frequent words that participants included in their responses and the emotions these responses were labelled with. Next, I explored word co-occurence and the associations of word pairs to emotions. Certain trends in word usage and emotional labels were identified throughout the analysis, however, an issue with the sample size was also noted.\n","date":1702944000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1702944000,"objectID":"953cf47cba974eb597bec69b1719b3fa","permalink":"https://example.com/project/pathos/","publishdate":"2023-12-19T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/pathos/","section":"project","summary":"Analyzing text patterns using data mining and regression analysis","tags":["Regression Analysis","Data Mining"],"title":"Pathos: Associations of Word Usage and Emotions","type":"project"},{"authors":["Max Melnikas","Alex Mellott","Naveen Pednekar"],"categories":null,"content":"This project was completed as part of a group effort with fellow biostatistics MS candidates Alex Mellott and Naveen Pednekar\nAbstract Sleep quality is a critical component of overall well-being, with numerous factors affecting its duration and depth. Among these factors, nutrition plays a pivotal yet underexplored role in regulating sleep quality. Accurately measuring an individual’s dietary intake is a fundamental challenge in nutritional research. The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) is an annual survey conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) that collects various health-related data and weights it to be nationally representative.\nThis project takes advantage of the large sample size of the NHANES dataset to draw associations between macronutrient predictors and sleep quality outcomes. Moreover, the demographic data collected through NHANES others us a way to investigate relevant confounders that are associated with both nutrition and sleep. We identified three final outcome variables related to sleep quality. One outcome was the duration of sleep, rounded to the closest half-hour, on weekdays; this outcome was modeled using multiple linear regression. Another relevant outcome was an indicator for whether the participant had ever told a doctor about trouble sleeping; this was modeled using multinomial regression. The final outcome was a categorical variable asking how often a participant felt overly sleepy during the past month. Furthermore, we aggregated our three sleep outcomes into a single overall metric of sleep quality and fit a Quasi-Poisson regression model.\nFiber intake was found to be positively associated with sleep quality, across linear, multinomial, and Quasi-Poisson regressions. Protein was found to have a negative association with length and quality of sleep across the Quasi-Poisson and linear models. Carbohydrates were found to have a harmful effect on sleep quality in the adjusted multinomial models.\n","date":1702166400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1702166400,"objectID":"d606de4324901fcb49244859d1ca98e3","permalink":"https://example.com/project/sweet-dreams/","publishdate":"2023-12-10T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/sweet-dreams/","section":"project","summary":"Associations between nutrition and sleep quality","tags":["Regression Analysis"],"title":"Sweet Dreams: A Regression Analysis of Macronutrient Intake and Sleep Quality","type":"project"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"I created a video for the final presentation in the linear algebra course at Brandeis.
